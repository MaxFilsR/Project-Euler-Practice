# Project Euler Practice

This repository is dedicated to practicing Project Euler problems as a means to learn and enhance my problem-solving skills using Python. The goal is to tackle one problem per day and maintain a record of the problems along with the approach taken to solve them.

## What is Project Euler

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a collection of challenging computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. Each problem is crafted to encourage the use of specific techniques and algorithms in order to find efficient solutions.

## Goals

The primary goal of this repository is to:
- Solve one Project Euler problem per day
- Document the problem statement and approach in a clear and concise manner
- Grow as a developer

## DevBlogs

I will be documenting my process on my [Portfolio Website](https://maxfilsremfort.com/devblogs). By documenting my approach to solving each problem, this repository serves as a record of how far I have come and as a way to receive feedback from those in the community.
